      <h1>Try Scribbly here</h1>
      <p>
        Use this page to experiment with Scribbly&apos;s drawing tools. Activate the overlay from the
        toolbar or the popup, draw a rectangle around any paragraph, or simply highlight the text
        you want summarized. Scribbly routes the selection to the on-device Summarizer API when
        available.
      </p>
      <h2>Long-form sample content</h2>
      <p>
        The Scribbly extension demonstrates how the new on-device models in Chrome can deliver
        privacy-preserving productivity helpers. Because the models run locally, none of the
        highlighted text leaves your machine unless you explicitly switch to cloud fallback mode and
        supply an API key. Even then, Scribbly annotates each summary with the mode it used so you
        can keep track of where your data flows.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “On-device AI keeps user data grounded. By downloading models proactively, the browser can
        offer real-time assistance without relying on servers.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Try drawing shapes, switching tools, and undoing strokes. When you draw a rectangle, Scribbly
        uses the coordinates to extract a text range before sending it to the Summarizer. You can
        open the side panel to review summaries, copy combined highlights, and adjust settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        To view the state of downloaded models, open <code>chrome://on-device-internals</code> in
        Chrome Canary. You can clear the local database by removing the extension or wiping the
        IndexedDB entry named <strong>scribbly</strong>.
